            <h2>Short Biography</h2>
    
             <p>
                A walrus is a large marine mammal. They usually reside in North Pole in the Artic Ocean, and subartic seas of the Northern Hemisphere. They can weigh to be around 4,400 pounds. They live to be about 20-30 years old in the wild. Walruses usually live in shallow waters, spending most of their lives on sea ice looking for mollusks to eat. They forage primarily on the sea floor and or from sea ice. They do not dive deep, and can remain submerges for a half hour. The walrus only has two predators a polar bear and a killer whale. </p>
